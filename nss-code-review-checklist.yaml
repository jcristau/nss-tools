- Formatting:
  - GTests are Google style
  - Other files are consistent style
  - Passes clang-format

- New functions:
  - New functions are added to the abi-check files
  - Everything that can be const, is
  - Gtests for the new functions
  - Additions to command-line utilities considered

- New Gtests:
  - Added to the shell-script runners

- Safety:
  - There are Gtests to cover the updated code
  - The tests check the success and failure cases
  - Everything that can be const, is
  - Variables are initialized
  - Pointers are checked before use on public functions
  - Out-params are not touched on error
  - Every function that can error is checked
  - Errors are propagated
  - Memory allocated is either passed to caller or freed before return
  - Memory allocated is freed on error paths
  - PORT_SetError() is called before return SECFailure
